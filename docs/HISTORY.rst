0.9.1 - 2017-04-20
------------------

**Changes**

- Added `ICatalog` and `ICatalogQuery` adapter for full search control. See docs for usage.
- Removed `query` module in favor of the new adapters.
- Removed multiple catalog query functionality. Please define a custom `ICatalog` adapter if you need it.
- Added generic route provider for all `portal_types`.
  N.B. The old-style route providers, e.g. `folders`, `documents` etc., are now obsolete.
       Please use the lower portal type name instead, e.g. `folder`, `docuememt` ...
- The `users` route shows now more details of the users and results are now batched.
- Removed default `getObjPositionInParent` sorting. Please specify explicitly via `sort_on`.
- UID of the plone site is now '0' instead of 0.
- Huge code refactoring and cleanup.
