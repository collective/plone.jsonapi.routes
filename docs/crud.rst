CRUD
====

Each content route provider shipped with this package, provides the basic CRUD
:ref:`Operations` functionality to `get`, `create`, `delete` and `update` the
resource handled.

.. versionadded:: 0.8.1
    Added route providers to `cut`, `copy` and `paste` contents


Unified API
-----------

:URL Schema: ``<BASE URL>/<OPERATION>/<uid:optional>``

There is a convenient and unified way to fetch the content without knowing the
resource. This unified resource is directly located at the :ref:`BASE_URL`.


Response Format
---------------

The response format of the unified `get` API differs from the default
:ref:`Response_Format` and omits the `items` list. The content information is
directly provided in the root of the returned JSON object.
Therefore it is only suitable to return a single object.


.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        _runtime: 0.00381,
        uid: "7455c9b14e3c48c9b0be19ca6a142d50",
        tags: [ ],
        portal_type: "Document",
        id: "front-page",
        description: "Welcome to Plone",
        api_url: "http://localhost:8080/Plone/@@API/plone/api/1.0/documents/7455c9b14e3c48c9b0be19ca6a142d50",
        effective: "1000-01-01T00:00:00+02:00",
        title: "Welcome to Plone",
        url: "http://localhost:8080/Plone/front-page",
        created: "2014-10-14T20:22:19+02:00",

    }


GET
---

The `get` route will return the content located at the given UID.

http://localhost:8080/Plone/@@API/plone/api/1.0/get/<uid:optional>

The given optional UID defines the target object to get. You can omit this UID
and specify the path to the object with a request parameter.

Example
.......

Getting an object by its **physical path**:

http://localhost:8080/Plone/@@API/plone/api/1.0/get?path=/Plone/folder

Or you can specify the **parent path** and the **id** of the object

http://localhost:8080/Plone/@@API/plone/api/1.0/get?parent_path=/Plone&id=folder


.. versionadded:: 0.4
    Adding 0 or the string `portal` as UID returns the portal Object.

.. versionadded:: 0.9.1
    The `get` route is now obsolete. Please use the base url to retrieve a content by uid, e.g.:
    http://localhost:8080/Plone/@@API/plone/api/1.0/<uid>
